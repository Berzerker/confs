2014-02-08 14:38:28	scottstamp	:\
2014-02-08 14:38:40	Glonn_	if you click the banner it costs them moeny
2014-02-08 14:38:42	Glonn_	not a lot
2014-02-08 14:38:48	Glonn_	like .1$ but still
2014-02-08 14:38:54	FireBeard	I never click any banner ever
2014-02-08 14:39:01	FireBeard	so there's that
2014-02-08 14:39:09	FireBeard	brb, I need to pee
2014-02-08 14:39:47	scottstamp	Glonn_, it actually connects to MBV staff afaik
2014-02-08 14:39:56	scottstamp	But the service it's based on isn't free.

2014-02-08 14:40:56	FireBeard	somebody explain to me
2014-02-08 14:41:17	FireBeard	that site has to pay for the live chat...?
2014-02-08 14:41:30	scottstamp	They pay for the live chat service, it's an API
2014-02-08 14:41:35	FireBeard	as in, I just cost them money?
2014-02-08 14:41:43	FireBeard	arg... :x
2014-02-08 14:41:50	scottstamp	LOL it's literally pennies.
2014-02-08 14:41:54	FireBeard	still
2014-02-08 14:42:12	scottstamp	It's more valuable to them to have it get abused even if it only helps one out of a hundred sales.
2014-02-08 14:42:14	Apsu	They pay for providing the service. You're not "costing" them money, as if its not something they are paying for on purpose to provide it to you.
2014-02-08 14:42:14	FireBeard	I really thought I was talking to somebody from MBV itself

2014-02-08 14:43:32	scottstamp	Yeah, Kayako, that's it.
2014-02-08 14:44:05	scottstamp	Bloody EXPENSIVE though. We wound up pirating it, lmao
2014-02-08 14:44:19	obi21	Hey scott still remember me ?
2014-02-08 14:44:30	scottstamp	We were talking like less than an hour ago, lol
2014-02-08 14:44:42	obi21	well you never know ^^
2014-02-08 14:44:54	scottstamp	Haha. Yeah I still remember you.
2014-02-08 14:44:56	obi21	Think I'm pulling the trigger on an ego twist and a kanger protank II
2014-02-08 14:45:02	obi21	to get a glass tank
2014-02-08 14:45:06	-->	stowelly (~stowelly@2001:41d0:8:7ae0::1) has joined ##vaperhangout
2014-02-08 14:45:09	obi21	think it's good ?
2014-02-08 14:45:12	scottstamp	Get the Aspire I linked you, it's a glass tank with a metal sleeve.
2014-02-08 14:45:24	scottstamp	Kanger's quality control on replacement coils has been garbage lately.
2014-02-08 14:45:43	FireBeard	coil it yourself then
2014-02-08 14:45:54	obi21	oh has it ? because I was happy with the price of the coils... It was 6euros for 5 pieces
2014-02-08 14:46:00	obi21	I'm a total newbie :/
2014-02-08 14:46:11	FireBeard	I've been looking at vids on how to do it, and it's really really easy
2014-02-08 14:46:31	scottstamp	It's stupidly easy, but still, you shouldn't _need_ to for a coil that's $2/ea
2014-02-08 14:46:36	FireBeard	all you need is wick and coil
2014-02-08 14:46:53	FireBeard	yea ok
2014-02-08 14:46:57	scottstamp	The fact that it sucks at all is annoying.
2014-02-08 14:46:58	obi21	http://www.e-cig4u.nl/anyvape-aspire-BDC
2014-02-08 14:47:00	obi21	this one ?
2014-02-08 14:47:07	scottstamp	Yeah.
2014-02-08 14:47:10	FireBeard	strange thing tho, because WHEN it works, Kanger is brilliant
2014-02-08 14:47:11	scottstamp	Oh wait, no
2014-02-08 14:47:20	FireBeard	I guess I've been lucky so far
2014-02-08 14:47:45	obi21	Yeah I like the design and larger tank of the kanger a lot more tbh
2014-02-08 14:47:53	scottstamp	Shit, they don't have glass aspires.
2014-02-08 14:47:54	scottstamp	D:
2014-02-08 14:48:03	obi21	aah
2014-02-08 14:48:21	obi21	I think I'll try my luck with kanger, is it for those that I can coil them myself too ?
2014-02-08 14:48:26	obi21	in case they're really bad I guess
2014-02-08 14:48:36	scottstamp	http://www.canvape.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VOASP3%2E5G < this is what I was thinking I linked you to.
2014-02-08 14:48:46	scottstamp	And yeah you can coil Kanger heads yourself.
2014-02-08 14:48:56	obi21	aah yeah that does look a lot nicer
2014-02-08 14:49:17	FireBeard	scottstamp: and very easy
2014-02-08 14:49:20	scottstamp	My Mom's got the mini version of that for her iTaste v3, it's nice.
2014-02-08 14:49:34	scottstamp	FireBeard, I'm not arguing, I agree they're easy as hell to recoil.
2014-02-08 14:49:35	FireBeard	but you do need both coil wire and wick
2014-02-08 14:49:50	obi21	Ok so I think I'll try my luck with the protank II then, a friend uses this and is happy with it, and if the coils really suck that bad I'll try my hand at home made
2014-02-08 14:50:04	obi21	You know if I can even find that here in the netherlands ??
2014-02-08 14:50:20	FireBeard	gheh, I'm .nl too
2014-02-08 14:50:28	obi21	Ooooh are you ?
2014-02-08 14:50:32	obi21	WHAT JUICE DO YOU USE
2014-02-08 14:50:32	FireBeard	yes I am
2014-02-08 14:50:39	obi21	and what website ?
2014-02-08 14:50:43	FireBeard	I use something called 'beliquid'
2014-02-08 14:50:51	FireBeard	but it's not the best I'd say
2014-02-08 14:50:53	obi21	is it good ?
2014-02-08 14:50:55	obi21	meh
2014-02-08 14:51:00	FireBeard	I get it at my local cigar store
2014-02-08 14:51:19	obi21	I'm gonna try monkyjuicE and I will try one bottle of happy liquid from germany just to see if it's really worth the price
2014-02-08 14:51:35	FireBeard	report back please
2014-02-08 14:51:39	obi21	So far I tried dekang and koko and I think I can find a lot better than that
2014-02-08 14:51:55	FireBeard	also, I JUST started vaping
2014-02-08 14:52:05	obi21	but being a total beginner I'm not really sure what I should be expecting really
2014-02-08 14:52:22	obi21	yh same here, 3 days in :)
2014-02-08 14:52:22	FireBeard	are you quitting smoking?
2014-02-08 14:52:30	obi21	yup, 1 pack + a day
2014-02-08 14:52:43	FireBeard	if so, just get something with like 12 or more mg per ml
2014-02-08 14:52:52	FireBeard	I find that 12mg/ml is not enough
2014-02-08 14:53:02	FireBeard	so I'm also looking for something better
2014-02-08 14:53:15	obi21	Yeah I started with 18 but I found myself sucking on the thing all day and I think it was making me a bit sick so I'm on 11 now
2014-02-08 14:53:29	obi21	vaping between 3 and 5ml a day at the moment
2014-02-08 14:53:31	FireBeard	11?
2014-02-08 14:53:41	scottstamp	I can tolerate 16mg a little bit, I usually vape ~8mg.
2014-02-08 14:53:46	scottstamp	~ because I eyeball it
2014-02-08 14:53:53	FireBeard	I need more, a lot more
2014-02-08 14:54:09	obi21	how much were you smoking ?
2014-02-08 14:54:13	FireBeard	but I only vape around 4ml
2014-02-08 14:54:25	FireBeard	obi21: between 25 and 40 cigs
2014-02-08 14:54:35	obi21	yh you were smoking more than me
2014-02-08 14:54:46	FireBeard	for 25 years
2014-02-08 14:54:54	obi21	I have a doctor girlfriend so she's been making me cut down
2014-02-08 14:55:00	obi21	13 years here
2014-02-08 14:55:00	scottstamp	Jesus FireBeard, that must have been an expensive habit.
2014-02-08 14:55:01	FireBeard	OH NO !! :D
2014-02-08 14:55:01	mxtm	any MBV root beer ezperiences?
2014-02-08 14:55:13	FireBeard	scottstamp: not really, see, I made my own cigs
2014-02-08 14:55:27	scottstamp	Tobacco and tubes, still not that cheap.
2014-02-08 14:55:31	scottstamp	Well, it's not here anyways.
2014-02-08 14:55:37	obi21	it is a lot cheaper
2014-02-08 14:55:37	FireBeard	no 'shaggies' but with the help of tobacco and tubes, indeed :)
2014-02-08 14:55:43	obi21	but yeah still not "cheap"
2014-02-08 14:55:43	FireBeard	no, still not cheap
2014-02-08 14:55:49	FireBeard	but quite a bit cheaper than real cigs
2014-02-08 14:56:02	scottstamp	Carton of tubes is $5, a can of tob is like $75 which is about a carton's worth
2014-02-08 14:56:10	obi21	wow
2014-02-08 14:56:12	scottstamp	A carton is 200 cigs, I don't know if they use that term over there.
2014-02-08 14:56:14	obi21	how much tob ??
2014-02-08 14:56:21	FireBeard	a carton of 200 tubes is like one euro here
2014-02-08 14:56:25	FireBeard	they're nothing
2014-02-08 14:56:32	obi21	yh the tubes are cheap as hell
2014-02-08 14:56:33	scottstamp	They used to be nothing here

2014-02-08 14:56:39	scottstamp	I don't know why they're expensive now.
2014-02-08 14:56:50	obi21	and the tob I dunno I didn't buy any in a long time but I'd say around 10euros for 100g ?
2014-02-08 14:56:53	FireBeard	because tax
2014-02-08 14:56:54	obi21	or maybe even less
2014-02-08 14:57:08	FireBeard	I always bought just loose packets of tobacco
2014-02-08 14:57:16	FireBeard	CHEAP tobacco even
2014-02-08 14:57:25	FireBeard	still, about 7 euro's per 50 grams
2014-02-08 14:57:39	obi21	ah yeah so it did go up a lot since I used to buy some :/
2014-02-08 14:57:42	scottstamp	I used to buy (read: steal from my parents) really cheap can tobacco and roll my own with rolling papers (no tubes)
2014-02-08 14:58:11	obi21	Yeah that's what I used to do when I was a teen as well, drum tobacco I remember
2014-02-08 14:58:17	FireBeard	I used to roll for about 2 decades

2014-02-08 14:58:44	scottstamp	I had navy cut tobacco, almost pipe cut, tasted like shit, smelled like shit.
2014-02-08 14:58:53	FireBeard	hmmm, no, more like rolling for 15, and tubing for 10 years
2014-02-08 14:58:58	FireBeard	that's more like it I think
2014-02-08 14:59:13	obi21	Firebeard, do you buy everything in shops then ?
2014-02-08 14:59:32	FireBeard	obi21: no, I got my setup from somebody online
2014-02-08 14:59:41	obi21	e-cig or ?
2014-02-08 14:59:46	obi21	e-cig4u even
2014-02-08 14:59:52	FireBeard	I guess he hated  the cheap shit I bought

2014-02-08 14:59:58	FireBeard	obi21: e-cig, yes
2014-02-08 15:00:13	FireBeard	he actually bought me two complete ones
2014-02-08 15:00:25	FireBeard	I don't know why
2014-02-08 15:00:37	obi21	well no complaints I guess ?

2014-02-08 15:00:48	FireBeard	no !!
2014-02-08 15:01:02	FireBeard	it's been brilliant
2014-02-08 15:01:08	obi21	But yeah my next mission is to find a good and affordable juice
2014-02-08 15:01:10	scottstamp	I upgraded my Mom from a kGo (eGo clone) battery and an iClear 16 to an iTaste v3 and an Aspire Vivi Nova Mini, she's going through juice twice as fast now lmao
2014-02-08 15:01:24	FireBeard	juice is almost always the same price, I find
2014-02-08 15:01:37	scottstamp	Cheapest way to get juice is to make your own.
2014-02-08 15:01:37	obi21	That german brand is like twice the price of everything else
2014-02-08 15:01:38	FireBeard	it's just the quality of it that differs, so it seems
2014-02-08 15:01:45	scottstamp	But I don't know how easy it is to get nic base in the NL
2014-02-08 15:01:58	FireBeard	German brands are always expensive :D
2014-02-08 15:02:09	obi21	the annoying thing with e-cig4u is that they only sell 10ml bottles or 30 for the dekang
2014-02-08 15:02:24	obi21	It's not hard to get SOMETHING, it's just that the choice is limited
2014-02-08 15:02:27	FireBeard	wait wait, back the truck up
2014-02-08 15:02:28	FireBeard	what?
2014-02-08 15:02:38	obi21	and it's all weird brands coming from poland or slovakia or something
2014-02-08 15:02:42	FireBeard	10ml should be around 3 to 4 euro
2014-02-08 15:02:59	obi21	yh the monkyjuicE ones are around that price, the german brand is like 8 euros
2014-02-08 15:03:10	FireBeard	don't get that
2014-02-08 15:03:18	FireBeard	that's WAY too expensive

2014-02-08 15:03:35	obi21	I might get just one bottle of this : http://www.e-cig4u.nl/Happy-Maracuja

2014-02-08 15:03:45	obi21	just to see if it's really different
2014-02-08 15:04:08	obi21	yeah I thought so too right ?
2014-02-08 15:04:17	obi21	scott for reference that's like 10US$
2014-02-08 15:04:21	obi21	for 10ml
2014-02-08 15:04:22	FireBeard	that's WAY too expensive
2014-02-08 15:04:55	FireBeard	wait wait
2014-02-08 15:05:02	FireBeard	it sais 'happy liquid'
2014-02-08 15:05:04	obi21	I just want something that tastes nice and does a decent amount of vapor...
2014-02-08 15:05:06	scottstamp	That's WAY overpriced.
2014-02-08 15:05:07	scottstamp	O_O
2014-02-08 15:05:16	FireBeard	that might be with some weed juice in it
2014-02-08 15:05:29	obi21	haha I don't think so, being from germany and all
2014-02-08 15:05:40	FireBeard	.nl sais the url
2014-02-08 15:05:49	obi21	yeah but the brand is german
2014-02-08 15:05:59	FireBeard	hmmmm ah
2014-02-08 15:05:59	scottstamp	That's just normal juice, and it's ridiculously overpriced.
2014-02-08 15:06:01	scottstamp	v_v
2014-02-08 15:06:07	obi21	Trots bieden wij u deze zeer smaakvolle, luxe liquidlijn uit Duitsland aan.
2014-02-08 15:06:18	FireBeard	to me, I'd guess it's liquid with some extra juice mixed in

2014-02-08 15:10:54	obi21	Yeah I know I was just talking in jest ^^
2014-02-08 15:11:04	obi21	they're not even part of france anyway
2014-02-08 15:11:07	FireBeard	from what I know it was a Brittish  thingy
2014-02-08 15:11:15	scottstamp	Canada is technically bi-lingual, we observe French and English as official languages. My province doesn't really give a fuck about French though, everything is English.
2014-02-08 15:11:18	FireBeard	but the thing is, a lot of Brits used to speak French
2014-02-08 15:11:31	scottstamp	There is a small island off the coast called St. Piere, that's a French colony.
2014-02-08 15:11:39	obi21	no I think part of it was english and part was french ?
2014-02-08 15:11:48	obi21	or something like that
2014-02-08 15:11:52	FireBeard	colony is the word I was after
2014-02-08 15:11:54	FireBeard	yes !
2014-02-08 15:12:06	obi21	yh quebec isn't a colony anymore
2014-02-08 15:12:08	FireBeard	I need to pee
2014-02-08 15:12:12	obi21	but maybe that island is I don't know
2014-02-08 15:13:05	scottstamp	I'm on an island, there's an island off our coast that _is_ technically part of France.
2014-02-08 15:13:16	obi21	TIL !
2014-02-08 15:13:21	scottstamp	Not many people live there, they don't even really have cards.

2014-02-08 15:13:43	obi21	I used to live in Tahiti, also a french island, different weather though I think
2014-02-08 15:14:01	scottstamp	Yeah, here we get two kinds of weather, shitty and shittier.

2014-02-08 15:18:06	radiosunderwater	they're just very..... light
2014-02-08 15:18:09	cardboardphone	vaporchef needs long steeping
2014-02-08 15:18:28	cardboardphone	i find that to mellow out the SUPER SWEET SUGAR attack that they all have on me

2014-02-08 15:19:05	obi21	what's steeping ?
2014-02-08 15:19:07	cardboardphone	i had the opposite experience but this was when they first opened their doors
2014-02-08 15:19:19	cardboardphone	was the most potent juice out aside from murdock's
2014-02-08 15:19:28	scottstamp	obi21, some juice needs to sit for a while after it's been mixed to bring out the flavours completely.
2014-02-08 15:19:29	cardboardphone	obi21: steeping is letting yur bottles just hang out and they 'age' a bit
2014-02-08 15:19:30	radiosunderwater	iunno, i'll drop the pb nomnoms in my stein full of hot
2014-02-08 15:19:44	obi21	ah ok I see, thanks

2014-02-08 15:26:30	DarkLapX	probably cause they charge so much for juice yo
2014-02-08 15:26:35	cardboardphone	probably
2014-02-08 15:26:37	DarkLapX	wish they'd offer 15ml bottles at least, then I'd try em
2014-02-08 15:26:49	DarkLapX	otherwise fuck em
2014-02-08 15:26:49	cardboardphone	a standard commercial property policy would cover the contents
2014-02-08 15:26:59	DarkLapX	I know they have that sample pack but 4ml bottles wtf
2014-02-08 15:27:09	cardboardphone	its the liability of the products that is expensive/hard to find
2014-02-08 15:27:18	DarkLapX	give me a 3 pack of 10ml for $22 or something and I'll bite
2014-02-08 15:27:43	DarkLapX	didn't get deserved to be robbed though, hate thieves

2014-02-08 15:56:08	radiosunderwater	their flavors are excellent, and I haven't had one that needed steeping, but again, b&m
2014-02-08 15:56:24	radiosunderwater	tru vapes is also pretty good, sweet cream and chocolate glazed donut being the standouts
2014-02-08 15:56:28	radiosunderwater	(same vendor)
2014-02-08 15:57:11	cardboardphone	i really only like ordering from a vendor if i can get 4-6 bottles for like $50 and get a true feel on their mixing skillz
2014-02-08 15:57:27	cardboardphone	im due for a vapemail purchase, its been a few months
2014-02-08 15:57:39	radiosunderwater	if I had to pick six from banzai
2014-02-08 15:57:41	cardboardphone	would be even better if i can sell off a few mods :)
2014-02-08 15:57:47	radiosunderwater	cardboardphone - what mods?

2014-02-08 15:59:13	cardboardphone	im debating on just having goss upgrade a few things on the duke, it was a cheap mod so its not really tying up a lot of cash
2014-02-08 15:59:26	Zoey	I really wonder where the juice I put in my tank goes when I shake it
2014-02-08 15:59:28	radiosunderwater	Scorpion is also pretty delicious, @cardboardphone I wouldn't buy anything vv, so no deal
2014-02-08 15:59:47	cardboardphone	versa 2 is a genny/mech :)

2014-02-08 17:34:19	Loetmichel	so: why?
2014-02-08 17:34:32	Loetmichel	they should last at least a month or two
2014-02-08 17:34:37	Loetmichel	and are DIRT cheap

2014-02-08 18:21:07	ThatRoo	Hey all, So my coil on my itaste 30 that came with my MVP just finally died. I was thinking about the costs of getting new coils vs just getting a new tank thats rebuildable. Could anyone reccommend a good rebuildable tank thats affordable?
2014-02-08 18:27:17	Zoey	I'm so sick of feeling like shit >.>
2014-02-08 18:27:27	Zoey	you could get a protank
2014-02-08 18:28:10	pwny	Zoey: Then fix it. Feel better.
2014-02-08 18:29:13	Zoey	that requires new meds
2014-02-08 18:29:17	Zoey	which requires me not being in school
2014-02-08 18:30:09	pwny	A new mindset is also helpful in many ways.
2014-02-08 18:30:14	scottstamp	If you want a *good* one, ThatRoo, you could consider a rebuildable like the Kayfun / Kayfun Lite. Not the real thing of course, that'd be a huge leap out of your league coming from an iClear 30, but there are a lot of very well priced clones.
2014-02-08 18:30:22	pwny	It won't fix everything, but it goes a long way :)
2014-02-08 18:30:34	scottstamp	If you want something convenient, just get a Protank

2014-02-08 18:31:13	ThatRoo	Well I'm quite a techical guy and good with working with small things.I also understand voltages resistances and wattage pretty well. I was looking at this one AGA-T2
2014-02-08 18:31:16	pwny	http://www.vividsmoke.com/accessories/rba-rda/hcigar-kayfun-3-1-clone.html <-- that's a good clone of a Kayfun 3.1, which is a great rebuildable.
2014-02-08 18:31:27	scottstamp	You'll hate yourself for buying an AGA-T2
2014-02-08 18:31:50	ThatRoo	Haha. Alright I wont then XD
2014-02-08 18:31:58	T0by_	imo, get what pwny linked.
2014-02-08 18:32:15	ThatRoo	Yea thats not too bad for price
2014-02-08 18:32:24	scottstamp	The AGA-T2 isn't inheriently bad, it's just a huge pain in the ass to build on.
2014-02-08 18:32:29	ThatRoo	Is it bad for being a clone?
2014-02-08 18:32:45	scottstamp	No, clones are usually fine unless they're poorly made.
2014-02-08 18:32:58	scottstamp	Counterfeits are what you need to whatch out for.

2014-02-08 18:33:43	ThatRoo	I know some juices crack poly
2014-02-08 18:34:26	scottstamp	You get a ring that replaces the poly made of steel
2014-02-08 18:34:40	scottstamp	Only obvious issue is that you can't see through it.

2014-02-08 18:38:49	scottstamp	It does.
2014-02-08 18:38:52	Budrick	Kayfun Lite/Lite+ is a straight 510, 3.1 might have the screwin thing
2014-02-08 18:38:54	scottstamp	It also has the adaptor ring.

2014-02-08 18:39:27	scottstamp	Ah, you're right Budrick.
2014-02-08 18:39:30	Budrick	I ditched the standard Kayfun mouthpiece on day one

2014-02-08 18:40:14	ThatRoo	Yea I think I will just drop the money and get this clone cause it will just be a good platform for me to play around with.
2014-02-08 18:40:26	ThatRoo	I wonder how it will look on an MVP XD
2014-02-08 18:40:30	ThatRoo	Haha
2014-02-08 18:40:53	T0by_	The Russian have an adapter for the drip tip. My KFL+ have the standard drip tips.
2014-02-08 18:40:55	FireBeard	here's a nutty idea: machine it yourself
2014-02-08 18:41:11	pwny	It looks really nice on my Provari 2.5 :)
2014-02-08 18:41:17	scottstamp	Lol it looks absolutely foolish ThatRoo, I have mine on an MVP
2014-02-08 18:41:31	scottstamp	But it's a kick-ass vape.

2014-02-08 18:42:10	scottstamp	Heh.
2014-02-08 18:42:15	FireBeard	machine it yourself
2014-02-08 18:42:19	Ogredude	yeah it's a BIIIG atty
2014-02-08 18:42:27	scottstamp	The Russian 91% all steel is actually heavier than my MVP v1.5
2014-02-08 18:42:31	Budrick	They look great on iTaste VTRs, but you have to slice bits of the VTR off to have it fit
2014-02-08 18:42:34	FireBeard	that'll be my next step
2014-02-08 18:43:00	scottstamp	Budrick, don't suppose you have a picture of that?

2014-02-08 18:43:53	Budrick	Been a few posts on ecr about slicing off the stupid ring
2014-02-08 18:44:01	Ogredude	that looks good, Budrick
2014-02-08 18:44:03	scottstamp	Understandably.
2014-02-08 18:44:05	Budrick	HAve to sand down the inside of the tube as well some
2014-02-08 18:44:06	FireBeard	wow, and I just have some 'beginners' stuff, compared to that !
2014-02-08 18:44:07	FireBeard	:o
2014-02-08 18:44:33	Budrick	Only reason I haven't got a VTR is because I'm not confident in my ability not to cock up that modification
2014-02-08 18:44:40	scottstamp	FireBeard, yeah, I don't suggest carving up a mod north of $90.
2014-02-08 18:45:01	famine-	meh a 490/500 microstick is sexier
2014-02-08 18:45:03	FireBeard	if you can machine it yourself, it'll be cheap

2014-02-08 18:45:53	scottstamp	If it'd fit on a Microstick I'd totally have one.
2014-02-08 18:45:54	Budrick	That's a few hours' use for me at most
2014-02-08 18:46:13	FireBeard	I'm vaping on 1000mAh
2014-02-08 18:46:20	FireBeard	and it's fine !
2014-02-08 18:46:26	FireBeard	cheers !
2014-02-08 18:46:30	scottstamp	My ghetto DNA mod is 1200mAh
2014-02-08 18:46:45	scottstamp	FireBeard, our low ohm coils use batteries way faster.
2014-02-08 18:46:56	FireBeard	ok
2014-02-08 18:47:01	famine-	Budrick, 650s only last me a few hours but the microstick uses mini gens so you would probably wrap north of 0.8
2014-02-08 18:47:03	Budrick	I'm not even at -that- low a resistance. 1.7o
2014-02-08 18:47:04	FireBeard	for me, this is fine ! :)
2014-02-08 18:47:19	Budrick	famine-: gens?
2014-02-08 18:47:24	FireBeard	to me, this is not a hobby
2014-02-08 18:47:25	scottstamp	Indeed, my mom has an 800mAh and it's plenty for what she uses FireBeard. :P
2014-02-08 18:47:33	famine-	Budrick, genesis atomizers
2014-02-08 18:47:42	FireBeard	to me this is a way to get my fix at a way lower risk
2014-02-08 18:47:50	Budrick	Well, surely anything that fits in the whole would work, but point taken
2014-02-08 18:48:06	Budrick	FireBeard: Yeah, I just turned into a fiendish chainvaper

2014-02-08 18:48:32	Budrick	When I was killing 2x 1300mAh ego-types in a day, it got too much :)
2014-02-08 18:48:39	FireBeard	a way to smoke a little safer
2014-02-08 18:48:53	Ogredude	Budrick: yeah, same here
2014-02-08 18:49:00	Ogredude	switched to an 18650 mod, now a battery lasts most of the day
2014-02-08 18:49:02	Budrick	FireBeard: Exactly my mindset at the start
2014-02-08 18:49:02	FireBeard	not a way to get more and more vape and nicotine in my body
2014-02-08 18:49:27	Budrick	But started upgrading since I was dissatisfied with cigalikes initially, then the ego setups etc.
2014-02-08 18:49:29	FireBeard	what changed?
2014-02-08 18:49:38	Budrick	I couldn't resist fiddling
2014-02-08 18:49:47	T0by_	noooooo! https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800
2014-02-08 18:49:47	Ogredude	huffing big clouds is fun!
2014-02-08 18:49:49	FireBeard	so you're stil hooked
2014-02-08 18:50:04	FireBeard	I am too, but I keep  it on the down low
2014-02-08 18:50:35	Budrick	I'm hooked still, but being unable to vape doesn't bother me half as much as not being able to smoke in whatever circumstances might cause it
2014-02-08 18:50:38	FireBeard	nobody cares about clouds but neckbeards
2014-02-08 18:50:43	T0by_	My goal is not to quit nicotine. My goal is to stay off analogs.
2014-02-08 18:50:52	FireBeard	to me, it's a better way of  smoking'
2014-02-08 18:50:52	famine-	Budrick, http://www.vaperev.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bliss-2.jpg < would be a nice atomizer for a vtr

2014-02-08 18:51:53	Budrick	Just being able to take a calming puff of something and be satisfied - that's the good shit
2014-02-08 18:51:56	famine-	FireBeard, clouds are a byproduct of a hot vape and most of us running low ohms are in it for the heat
2014-02-08 18:52:01	FireBeard	to me it's no hobby, to me i's a way to live a little longer

2014-02-08 19:06:23	T0by_	The growth in # of users have been big though.
2014-02-08 19:06:24	FireBeard	those were non existant for normal users, man
2014-02-08 19:06:29	FireBeard	c'mon
2014-02-08 19:06:32	Budrick	From general browsing it seems like the tech reached a decent level in 2011/12 or so, critical mass of awareness definitely reached last year though
2014-02-08 19:07:30	Budrick	So lots of disposable brands suddenly -everywhere- in the latter half of 2013, at least in the UK, and ego-type starter kits a lot lot more visible here
2014-02-08 19:07:46	famine-	FireBeard, eh they were around for anyone with google
2014-02-08 19:08:13	FireBeard	and I knew about them, but they had a lot of problems
2014-02-08 19:08:40	FireBeard	mostly high costs JUST to get started
2014-02-08 19:08:53	FireBeard	which has since come down
2014-02-08 19:09:19	FireBeard	more places to get liquid, etc

2014-02-08 19:11:20	FireBeard	maybe not the tech, but what about the new companies willing to manufacture en masse?
2014-02-08 19:12:00	FireBeard	to me, I only learned about it being an actual viable alternative last year
2014-02-08 19:12:07	FireBeard	so I go by that
2014-02-08 19:12:26	Budrick	That's what I mean by awareness reaching a sort of critital mass
2014-02-08 19:12:47	FireBeard	yep !
2014-02-08 19:13:06	Budrick	Still haven't randomly encountered anyone using more than an ego setup in the street here though
2014-02-08 19:13:08	FireBeard	it's reaching adulthood
2014-02-08 19:13:17	Budrick	They definitely exist, I just haven't seen any I don't already know :p
2014-02-08 19:13:20	FireBeard	not quite there yet, but it's getting there for sure

2014-02-08 20:01:41	Apsu	VeryLarge-eGo: The way I 'solved' it was to assemble the tank in a certain way.

2014-02-08 20:01:58	VeryLarge-eGo	it has the holes on the beauty ring
2014-02-08 20:02:18	scottstamp	You could drill the plinth that came with the Protank.
2014-02-08 20:02:18	Apsu	Take off the bottom plate, screw it into the connector.
2014-02-08 20:02:18	Apsu	Then insert the coil head into the plate, until it just makes contact and can fire
2014-02-08 20:02:35	Apsu	Then attach the rest of the tank, and test the airflow through it before filling
2014-02-08 20:02:46	scottstamp	^ would work too

2014-02-08 20:19:40	cardboardphone	indoor vaping bans do not affect vape stores
2014-02-08 20:19:48	cardboardphone	similar to how you can smoke inside tobacco stores
2014-02-08 20:19:57	famine-	cardboardphone, they can depending on the locale
2014-02-08 20:19:58	slumberland1	we have a tobacco retail establishment exemption

2014-02-08 20:27:19	dr_kludge1	i mean thats an overreach even with cigs
2014-02-08 20:27:24	FireBeard	Apsu: I smoked for 25 years
2014-02-08 20:27:30	dr_kludge1	how can you enforce a law saying you cant smoke a cig on a sidewalk or in an alley
2014-02-08 20:27:38	dr_kludge1	people that dont live in the city will have no idea
2014-02-08 20:27:38	FireBeard	so I thought it'd be no problem
2014-02-08 20:27:45	scottstamp	dr_kludge1, exactly.
2014-02-08 20:27:46	Glonn	so my friend has an oxygen canulla, if you dont know what that is it's what you get at hospitals to administer oxygen through your nose
2014-02-08 20:27:49	Glonn	and i can confirm
2014-02-08 20:27:51	cardboardphone	idk im no activist
2014-02-08 20:27:56	Glonn	it does not work with vapes
2014-02-08 20:28:02	scottstamp	You're technically not allowed to smoke on our uni campus
2014-02-08 20:28:05	scottstamp	but it's a BIG campus
2014-02-08 20:28:05	cardboardphone	tbh im falling away from the community i cant stand most aspects of it anymore

2014-02-08 20:28:21	dr_kludge1	im just surprised how everyone gets so up in arms about shit
2014-02-08 20:28:30	dr_kludge1	but not when it doesnt suit their personal needs
2014-02-08 20:28:32	cardboardphone	basically all you can do is bring up your points to the council or whatever
2014-02-08 20:28:34	FireBeard	Apsu: indeed :o
2014-02-08 20:28:42	cardboardphone	if they pass it you can file a lawsuit to appeal
2014-02-08 20:28:46	dr_kludge1	welp they already voted unanimously to do it
2014-02-08 20:28:49	dr_kludge1	now they just need to draft it
2014-02-08 20:28:55	dr_kludge1	so i guess monday im gonna start making phone calls
2014-02-08 20:29:04	dr_kludge1	to try and at least get them to not lump vaping in with smoking for this thing
2014-02-08 20:29:08	cardboardphone	talk to your councilperson figure out if they can make concessions

2014-02-08 20:33:02	FireBeard	yea, no, I hate it ! :D
2014-02-08 20:33:06	Apsu	Cigarette tobacco has an MAOI that combines with the nicotine to form a much more powerfully addictive experience.
2014-02-08 20:33:10	cardboardphone	its not a binary system :)

2014-02-08 20:33:50	FireBeard	means a reduction at half

2014-02-08 20:34:00	slumberland1	i dunno. which vaping groups have you been supporting to promote your interests in legislature?
2014-02-08 20:34:10	pwny	Or, just let those who want to wreck their lungs with cancer do so.

2014-02-08 20:36:31	pr0metheu5	man, the kanger clearomizers are so much cheaper on their own website.. but let me guess, they probably ship from somewhere outside the US right?
2014-02-08 20:36:56	pr0metheu5	I'm new to all this btw, only have 2 clearomizers atm and thinking of purchasing a juice or two more, figure I could use another clearomizer. I have a kanger evod starter kit.
2014-02-08 20:37:00	FireBeard	about $6 or so, right?
2014-02-08 20:37:08	FireBeard	they're great !
2014-02-08 20:37:10	slumberland1	thats the wholesale price
2014-02-08 20:37:16	slumberland1	you won't get that from kanger
2014-02-08 20:37:24	slumberland1	pr0metheu5: what country are you in?
2014-02-08 20:37:31	pr0metheu5	A 5pc/pack is $18. My brick and mortar store in philly sold me a single clearomizer for about $20.
2014-02-08 20:37:32	FireBeard	7 to 8 then
2014-02-08 20:37:33	pr0metheu5	I'm in the US

2014-02-08 20:38:21	slumberland1	vapedojo is one of the biggest kanger dealers in the country
2014-02-08 20:38:24	pr0metheu5	It's still good to go in to a store and get some advice and stuff from an employee there, you know? Especially since I'm a newb.

2014-02-08 20:42:34	scottstamp	The average consumed cigarette delivers 1.8-2.2mg of nicotine, so if you're vaping 16mg/mL, 1mL ~= 8 cigarettes of nicotine.
2014-02-08 20:42:44	pr0metheu5	I stopped completely 48+ hours ago, and have been alternating between 12mg and 6mg of juice since

2014-02-08 20:43:47	Zoey	I'm at 6mg ( one bottle is 8mg only because that's the lowest they went), after these bottles are gone I'm going to 0
2014-02-08 20:43:58	pr0metheu5	so do you think vapers ultimately end up consuming more nicotine than they would via cigarettes?
2014-02-08 20:44:00	FireBeard	a little too little for me

2014-02-08 20:44:31	Zoey	when I first started I went through a blu cartridge a day

2014-02-08 20:44:31	FireBeard	nice
2014-02-08 20:44:34	cardboardphone	lul
2014-02-08 20:44:46	lumixter	http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/trending/McGruff-The-Crime-Dog-gets-16-years-for-having-1000-pot-plants-and-a-grenade-launcher.html
2014-02-08 20:44:46	pr0metheu5	The way I'm looking at it, if it were just the nicotine I was hooked to, and what's bad for me, I wouldn't be going through such severe withdrawal these days considering I'm vaping.
2014-02-08 20:44:47	lumixter	roflmao
2014-02-08 20:44:56	cardboardphone	slumberland1: if you like lifes a bitch from nas you may like elzi's album, detroit state of mind
2014-02-08 20:45:08	cardboardphone	he basically did a remake with some dilla beats and houseshoues too
2014-02-08 20:45:10	scottstamp	Nicotine isn't really bad for you mate.
2014-02-08 20:45:12	FireBeard	wow, I havent seen that for a long time; roflmao
2014-02-08 20:45:17	Zoey	it's not so much the nic that I'm addicted it's the whole oral fixation I have
2014-02-08 20:45:23	scottstamp	You can OD on it, but you'll get sick LONG before you get anywhere near a dangerous level.
2014-02-08 20:45:46	pr0metheu5	Zoey, that too. Also, I read on Reddit yesterday, reserach has shown it's more so even the instant gratification and "act" of "pressing a button to get a fix," that is addictive, as shown by lab rats.
2014-02-08 20:46:05	pr0metheu5	This "pressing a button," is almost equivalent to the cherry burning smokers are usually seen staring at, as they puff on
2014-02-08 20:46:20	Zoey	I like the feel of a cig better than my MVP
2014-02-08 20:46:23	Zoey	dunno why
2014-02-08 20:46:28	pr0metheu5	they're so damn awesome -_-
2014-02-08 20:46:34	slumberland1	you're using the wrong topper, Zoey
2014-02-08 20:46:35	pr0metheu5	I would loooooooooove one right now
2014-02-08 20:46:48	scottstamp	Two months analog free and loving it.
2014-02-08 20:46:52	pr0metheu5	but I realize I start from scratch and will hate myself for it.. 2 days of hard work down the drain
2014-02-08 20:47:00	Zoey	mew slumberland1 ?
2014-02-08 20:47:04	scottstamp	There's a pack of cigarettes right next to me, sealed, never opened.
2014-02-08 20:47:12	scottstamp	I keep 'em there just to remind myself what I'm switching for.
2014-02-08 20:47:14	cardboardphone	sorry, elmatic, not detroit state of mind
2014-02-08 20:47:19	pr0metheu5	that's pretty cool, scottstamp
2014-02-08 20:47:28	Zoey	there's a pack in my purse but they don't belong to me
2014-02-08 20:47:31	pr0metheu5	it's success stories like yours that help a lot of people make the switch, I'm sure, just like me
2014-02-08 20:47:33	leachim666	Is anyone on hsngout?
2014-02-08 20:47:41	scottstamp	There's four more packs that I keep on my bureau because I can't find anyone who wants them. LOL

2014-02-08 20:51:33	slumberland1	seroquel is the mind killer
2014-02-08 20:51:33	leachim666	It made her really angry and tired
2014-02-08 20:51:34	scottstamp	Seroquel is notorious for knocking me the FUCK out. Never been on Remeron though.
2014-02-08 20:51:35	slumberland1	fuck fear
2014-02-08 20:51:35	cardboardphone	idk about what goes on in philly..i can reach out to some friends and see
2014-02-08 20:51:45	cardboardphone	but they are all yinzers and dont get out much
2014-02-08 20:51:50	Zoey	slumberland1, it's the only thing that keeps me out of the hospital
2014-02-08 20:52:02	Zoey	at least it did until the last 3 months.
2014-02-08 20:52:08	Symmetry_	hey slumberland1 do you happen to have a link to the honey fuck recipe?
2014-02-08 20:52:11	Zoey	and the last 2 weeks the remeron decided to poop out too
2014-02-08 20:52:18	Symmetry_	or if you can just list it out I'd love it

2014-02-08 20:52:52	scottstamp	Zoey, ever tried welbutrin complimenting something else?
2014-02-08 20:53:09	scottstamp	I'm on cymbalta with 300mg of welbutrin now, working impressively well.
2014-02-08 20:53:22	Zoey	I can't take SNRI or SSRI's. they make me super manic (then super suicidal in short order)
2014-02-08 20:53:30	scottstamp	:( that sucks.
2014-02-08 20:53:46	Zoey	so I'm insanely limited in meds I can take (further limited by lack of health insurance)
2014-02-08 20:53:47	leachim666	My girlfriend was on prozac for a minute
2014-02-08 20:53:49	scottstamp	Are you diagnosed as anything besides depressed?
2014-02-08 20:53:53	leachim666	Then she tried to take the bottle
2014-02-08 20:54:04	Zoey	I'm rapid cycling bipolar II
2014-02-08 20:54:09	scottstamp	Fuuuuun.
2014-02-08 20:54:15	leachim666	No not fun
2014-02-08 20:54:17	scottstamp	So lithium's out too.
2014-02-08 20:54:19	slumberland1	i'm slow cycling, but stress causes rapid cycling
2014-02-08 20:54:21	scottstamp	leachim666, sarcastic.
2014-02-08 20:54:26	Zoey	I knew he was being sarcastic
2014-02-08 20:54:29	slumberland1	and ptsd means i'm easily stressed ;)
2014-02-08 20:54:34	Zoey	I'm in college
2014-02-08 20:54:37	Zoey	that's ALWAYS stressful
2014-02-08 20:54:47	scottstamp	I work from home and live with my parents
2014-02-08 20:54:49	scottstamp	life is too hard
2014-02-08 20:55:01	leachim666	I know, I just wish I could help her out instead of just watching her suffer :/
2014-02-08 20:55:25	Zoey	eh. I vented on reddit. need to put food in me and then I'm probably going to go sleep
2014-02-08 20:55:39	scottstamp	:c well feel better Zoey.

2014-02-08 20:56:03	scottstamp	Did the trick!
2014-02-08 20:56:10	Zoey	Valium doesn't affect me
2014-02-08 20:56:16	Zoey	effect*
2014-02-08 20:56:17	leachim666	Benzos manf
2014-02-08 20:56:18	Zoey	... whatever
2014-02-08 20:56:19	scottstamp	As a sedative? Nor me.
2014-02-08 20:56:28	scottstamp	It works for headaches and anxiety though.
2014-02-08 20:56:32	Ogredude	ok this Cream of Mint flavor is definitely on my list
2014-02-08 20:56:37	Zoey	I had an amazing anti-migraine med.
2014-02-08 20:56:41	Zoey	but it's $75 a pill
2014-02-08 20:56:43	scottstamp	Creme de Menthe?

2014-02-08 20:57:46	leachim666	Fucking big pharma
2014-02-08 20:57:48	Zoey	Not that I know of.
2014-02-08 20:58:01	scottstamp	Merck still has the uh...
2014-02-08 20:58:10	scottstamp	fuck the thing that you get when you register something

2014-02-08 20:59:00	Zoey	costco doesn't have it :(
2014-02-08 20:59:03	leachim666	Costcos online pharmacy is the shit
2014-02-08 20:59:07	scottstamp	I have federally-sponsored health insurance, I get pretty much all the drugs for free.
2014-02-08 20:59:07	pwny	Zoey: You *just* linked to the wikipedia article for the generic.
2014-02-08 20:59:14	scottstamp	or next to free.
2014-02-08 20:59:19	Zoey	LOL I googled maxalt and that popped up
2014-02-08 20:59:20	leachim666	People dont know you dont need a membership to use it
2014-02-08 20:59:22	leachim666	liquor too
2014-02-08 20:59:39	Zoey	I used to go to costco for my meds, then the pharmacy that's in my clinic beat them
2014-02-08 20:59:43	Zoey	and requires less up front
2014-02-08 20:59:46	Ogredude	liquor in this state is all state-run, but you don't need a membership to use the costco food booth either
2014-02-08 20:59:50	Ogredude	their smoothies are delicious
2014-02-08 20:59:58	scottstamp	I <3 their poutine.
2014-02-08 21:00:19	Zoey	I pay $13 for 30 200mg seroquel, and $12 for 60 remeron
2014-02-08 21:00:36	scottstamp	I'd probably get that entire script for $3.

2014-02-08 21:01:15	scottstamp	Has nothing to do with free healthcare.
2014-02-08 21:01:23	leachim666	Oh muh bad
2014-02-08 21:01:24	Zoey	No one has the generic

2014-02-08 21:01:32	Zoey	lost mine the day I turned 18
2014-02-08 21:01:40	slumberland1	i pay as much for my insurance as i do for my meds
2014-02-08 21:01:41	scottstamp	My mom worked for the federal government and wound up on disability (now retired on disability) so we have kick-ass insurance.
2014-02-08 21:01:51	slumberland1	my insurance pays for 50% of my meds
2014-02-08 21:01:55	leachim666	I have mine until 26

2014-02-08 21:02:10	phillyvaper_d	I got into vaping 2 years ago when I first tried quitting analogs, and every place was doing "sample packs" and such with their juices.. I haven't seen much of that happening recently. Is it a thing anymore?
2014-02-08 21:02:17	cdsboy	leachim666: I figured out weechat :D
2014-02-08 21:02:22	pwny	(Generic for Maxalt, that is)

2014-02-08 21:02:52	phillyvaper_d	apparently, smoking is linked with self medication in schizophrenics and people with bipolar disorder
2014-02-08 21:02:55	Zoey	my dr was on my ass about me smoking, so I got my ecig
2014-02-08 21:03:09	leachim666	Also can you you invite me to hangout cdsboy?

2014-02-08 21:05:28	scottstamp	I used to self medicate with weed. Expensive, but it worked for like two years.

2014-02-08 21:10:53	scottstamp	How many packs?
2014-02-08 21:10:56	FireBeard	it's cheap and gets the job done
2014-02-08 21:10:56	Ogredude	A bear walks into a bar in my town and asks for a beer. "Sorry," says the bartender, "we don't serve beer to bears in bars in Boise." The bear gets really pissed off, and eats a woman sitting next to him at the bar. "Now gimme a beer!" "Sorry," says the bartender, "we don't serve beer to bears on drugs in bars in Boise." "Drugs? I'm not on drugs!"
2014-02-08 21:11:01	audreycloudrat	scottstamp: like twelve
2014-02-08 21:11:05	scottstamp	Very nice then.
2014-02-08 21:11:05	Ogredude	"Oh? Then what about that bar bitch you ate?"
2014-02-08 21:11:07	audreycloudrat	we weighed around 50-60
2014-02-08 21:11:49	scottstamp	Ogredude, is the punch-line that the bear isn't a beer?
2014-02-08 21:11:52	scottstamp	...
2014-02-08 21:11:56	Ogredude	the beer isn't in the bear
2014-02-08 21:12:00	 *	scottstamp *facepalm*
2014-02-08 21:12:01	FireBeard	of course, I don't drink 5 or 10 beers... No, I drink 30+
2014-02-08 21:12:32	FireBeard	nothing to be proud of tho
2014-02-08 21:12:33	audreycloudrat	FireBeard: at that point it isn't beer
2014-02-08 21:12:39	FireBeard	it is
2014-02-08 21:12:42	Zoey	that's like drinking gold
2014-02-08 21:12:45	FireBeard	it s still beer
2014-02-08 21:12:45	audreycloudrat	what kind of bewer though
2014-02-08 21:12:46	audreycloudrat	beer
2014-02-08 21:13:06	FireBeard	what are you talking about?
2014-02-08 21:13:10	scottstamp	I hate liquor w/ gold flakes.
2014-02-08 21:13:11	audreycloudrat	what beer do you drink 30 of
2014-02-08 21:13:18	scottstamp	Always makes it taste weird as fuck.
2014-02-08 21:13:36	Zoey	oh. goldslautter ?
2014-02-08 21:13:36	FireBeard	ah, mostly Heineken half litres
2014-02-08 21:13:40	audreycloudrat	ew
2014-02-08 21:14:00	FireBeard	ew to the export yes
2014-02-08 21:14:08	FireBeard	but the local Heineken is fine
2014-02-08 21:14:24	scottstamp	That's 60mL of alcohol. I intend to finish this fifth of rum tonight, which will be 300mL of alcohol.
2014-02-08 21:14:44	FireBeard	I do this every day
2014-02-08 21:14:49	scottstamp	Erm.
2014-02-08 21:14:50	FireBeard	sadly
2014-02-08 21:14:53	scottstamp	You have bigger problems than smoking.
2014-02-08 21:14:54	audreycloudrat	why
2014-02-08 21:14:55	FireBeard	it's not a contest
2014-02-08 21:15:10	FireBeard	because  addiction
2014-02-08 21:15:40	slumberland1	does anyone like neopolitan ice cream sandwiches or chocolate and strawberry crepes?
2014-02-08 21:15:45	Ogredude	damn, I'm gonna have to refill this tank before I head out
2014-02-08 21:15:48	Zoey	me
2014-02-08 21:15:53	Ogredude	just filled it a couple hours ago
2014-02-08 21:16:06	scottstamp	tbh that's not an awful lot of alcohol for an addict FireBeard. You should talk to a counsellor, you could come off of that cold turkey without any medical issues.
2014-02-08 21:16:22	FireBeard	scottstamp: you tell that to my liver
2014-02-08 21:16:26	scottstamp	Most addicts drink to the point where quitting could be potentially fatal.
2014-02-08 21:16:28	FireBeard	to be honest, it really is...
2014-02-08 21:16:33	FireBeard	but of course, you know better
2014-02-08 21:16:35	slumberland1	Zoey:  http://goodguyvapes.com/collections/epicus-nebula-vapor/products/creme-de-la-crepe
2014-02-08 21:16:36	FireBeard	wich is fine
2014-02-08 21:16:42	slumberland1	thats what i'm rocking right now
2014-02-08 21:16:54	slumberland1	its a local maker
2014-02-08 21:17:07	slumberland1	we started him out in wholesale, and now he's supplying henley in manhattan
2014-02-08 21:17:09	scottstamp	Eh, not in a pissing contest sort of way FireBeard, I just know a lot about hepatic-related issues.
2014-02-08 21:17:13	FireBeard	I've been drinking like this for 15+ years, and my liver is shot
2014-02-08 21:17:16	slumberland1	for likeâ¦. 10 dollars more a bottle
2014-02-08 21:17:18	scottstamp	(OD'd a few times, my liver barely works)
2014-02-08 21:17:18	FireBeard	but of course you know better
2014-02-08 21:17:26	FireBeard	so tell me all your knowledge
2014-02-08 21:17:46	pwny	arg, I can't wait to get my GLV order :x
2014-02-08 21:17:49	FireBeard	yea, I'm living it
2014-02-08 21:17:53	slumberland1	now to con some poor fuck into buying my RSST
2014-02-08 21:17:54	scottstamp	Well it's just that drinking that amount wouldn't cause issues that most alcoholics have to worry about (like death) during withdrawal.
2014-02-08 21:18:00	slumberland1	i hate that thing for one reason, and one reason only
2014-02-08 21:18:20	FireBeard	scottstamp: we'll find out monday then eh
2014-02-08 21:18:22	slumberland1	and this let me narrow it down
2014-02-08 21:18:31	FireBeard	thank you for educating me
2014-02-08 21:18:35	slumberland1	the fucking gasket on the RSST is ballsacks, for the pyrex one
2014-02-08 21:18:56	scottstamp	I'm not saying ignore medical advice, I'm not an M.D., I just know a lot of this stuff from experience and independent study.
2014-02-08 21:19:12	FireBeard	so, what ARE you saying
2014-02-08 21:19:27	scottstamp	I'm saying you stand a good chance of recovery if you really dedicate to it.
2014-02-08 21:19:30	FireBeard	I'm having a check every year
2014-02-08 21:19:33	Ogredude	slumberland1: yeah?
2014-02-08 21:19:39	FireBeard	because of severe liver problems
2014-02-08 21:19:45	FireBeard	so
2014-02-08 21:19:54	slumberland1	Ogredude: 2 issues, 2 sides of what can go wrong
2014-02-08 21:19:54	audreycloudrat	slumberland1: what's so bad about it
2014-02-08 21:20:00	slumberland1	weeping down the bottom of the tank
2014-02-08 21:20:03	scottstamp	The damaged portion of your liver is damaged, that's it, nothing can help it. But most of your liver that's being hindered by alcohol consumption would begin functioning normally.
2014-02-08 21:20:10	FireBeard	oh god, please stfu
2014-02-08 21:20:12	slumberland1	or, overtightened, you take a stiff pull and it floods your deck
2014-02-08 21:20:24	Ogredude	ugh
2014-02-08 21:20:26	scottstamp	Sorry mate. I'm just encouraging you to get help, honestly.
2014-02-08 21:20:34	FireBeard	I'm 40 plus
2014-02-08 21:20:38	FireBeard	you are what
2014-02-08 21:20:40	slumberland1	the AL-1 has no gasket, so its totally fine
2014-02-08 21:20:41	FireBeard	20>
2014-02-08 21:20:45	FireBeard	?
2014-02-08 21:20:47	slumberland1	its a little harder to fill, though
2014-02-08 21:20:49	scottstamp	That doesn't mean it's too late to make a better decision.
2014-02-08 21:20:56	FireBeard	please shut up

2014-02-08 21:35:06	famine-	radiosunderwater, meh the best battery out there is 22A
2014-02-08 21:35:14	scottstamp	Hmm, yep that's going on my list.
2014-02-08 21:35:34	scottstamp	I think I poured four shots in this rum and coke... LOL
2014-02-08 21:35:56	radiosunderwater	famine- I agree, but I run crazy subohm builds too much to be bothered
2014-02-08 21:35:56	dr_kludge1	180mL?
2014-02-08 21:36:02	scottstamp	100
2014-02-08 21:36:14	dr_kludge1	das not 4 shots
2014-02-08 21:36:20	scottstamp	Oh, alcohol
2014-02-08 21:36:39	scottstamp	Well it's a fifth and I poured out... probably 140-160mL
2014-02-08 21:37:00	famine-	radiosunderwater, you arent getting anymore power from a crazy sub ohm build on a vtc3/4 because of voltage sag
2014-02-08 21:37:27	radiosunderwater	famine- I'm more concerned about safety
2014-02-08 21:37:29	scottstamp	Aren't the VTC4's fine with sag up to 20A draw?
2014-02-08 21:37:37	scottstamp	radiosunderwater, safety-wise you're fine.
2014-02-08 21:37:49	famine-	scottstamp, they are a good 0.15V lower than samsungs
2014-02-08 21:38:10	scottstamp	At 20A?
2014-02-08 21:38:38	famine-	yea, the sonys sag to about 3.5v and the samsungs are up at 3.65ish

2014-02-08 21:47:32	sleepynate	12 bucks a cell though?
2014-02-08 21:47:46	radiosunderwater	hmm ok
2014-02-08 21:47:47	scottstamp	They're in dwindling supply and I guess there are a few fans of them.
2014-02-08 21:47:53	radiosunderwater	so it's 30a rated and 20a continuous
2014-02-08 21:47:55	radiosunderwater	and 60a pulse
2014-02-08 21:48:12	scottstamp	tbh pulse ratings are still pretty applicable to what we do.
2014-02-08 21:48:22	scottstamp	But you need to factor sag.
2014-02-08 21:48:28	radiosunderwater	what's the difference between max rated and continuous?
2014-02-08 21:48:35	radiosunderwater	that's the bit that's confusing me
2014-02-08 21:48:39	sleepynate	we should get together and order a 20-pack of LG ICRs to split up
2014-02-08 21:48:41	scottstamp	Max rated = more draw than that and you'll pretty much instantly blow them
2014-02-08 21:48:47	sleepynate	they come in lots of 20 but I only want 2 :P

2014-02-08 21:49:05	scottstamp	Guest76830, why VV over VW?

2014-02-08 21:49:18	scottstamp	not knocking VV, just curious.

2014-02-08 21:49:20	Guest76830	VW works too
2014-02-08 21:49:29	scottstamp	MBV has a good price on MVP's right now.
2014-02-08 21:49:32	Guest76830	I'm just looking for a good vendor that has everything at a good price, which is hard
2014-02-08 21:49:42	Guest76830	no I want a tube mod

2014-02-08 21:49:57	scottstamp	Finding everything at a good price is nearly impossible, you need to shop around at least a little.
2014-02-08 21:50:02	famine-	Guest76830, pretty much the only vv tube mod worth buying is the provari
2014-02-08 21:50:08	sleepynate	Guest76830: try pennyvapers.com
2014-02-08 21:50:11	Guest76830	ok, what has kayfun/russian lite with the provari

2014-02-08 21:50:25	famine-	Guest76830, only place selling provaris is provape
2014-02-08 21:50:46	scottstamp	I'd sell you a Russian 91% but I'm sorta falling in love with it.
2014-02-08 21:50:52	Guest76830	alright it doesn't have to be provari just a vv/vw with those kayfun/russian 91
2014-02-08 21:51:03	s-mies	They have resellers in teh EU at least
2014-02-08 21:51:07	Guest76830	maybe ohm meters, wire and cotton too?
2014-02-08 21:51:09	s-mies	Would make sense to do the same in 'murica

2014-02-08 21:55:58	scottstamp	Don't be. I had a faulty KeCig K100 that kept shorting batteries, worst case is you vent a battery (it'll get extremely hot), next to worst you just melt the coating and need to replace the bat.

2014-02-09 00:01:02	sixninetynine	i got screwed in the work laptop dept
2014-02-09 00:01:23	sixninetynine	i got mine right before they upgraded to retinas
2014-02-09 00:01:24	sixninetynine	literally like a coupla weeks
2014-02-09 00:01:28	grumblez	ouch
2014-02-09 00:01:45	sixninetynine	but i did get the better video card
2014-02-09 00:02:07	sixninetynine	2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB L3 cache
2014-02-09 00:02:13	sixninetynine	8gb mem
2014-02-09 00:02:23	lumixter	watching old simpsons eps and it's amazing how relevant they still are
2014-02-09 00:02:29	sixninetynine	nvidia geforce gt 650M
2014-02-09 00:02:34	sixninetynine	15"
2014-02-09 00:02:41	grumblez	same gfx card in my retina :) heh
2014-02-09 00:03:39	grumblez	newer rMBPs have the 750m tho.. i want one. heh
2014-02-09 00:03:51	sixninetynine	yeah but all the yungbludz at work got the bottom of the bucket retinas
2014-02-09 00:03:56	sixninetynine	same one i just replaced my wife's MBA with
2014-02-09 00:04:02	sixninetynine	intel iris or whatever
2014-02-09 00:04:21	grumblez	heh
2014-02-09 00:04:38	grumblez	intel graphics are worthless. cant even enqueue multi-dimensional OpenCL kernels on them
2014-02-09 00:04:59	grumblez	no CL texture support either
2014-02-09 00:06:56	leachim6	yeah man, I hate when I have to do that thing you just said there.
2014-02-09 00:07:05	grumblez	lol :D
2014-02-09 00:07:37	grumblez	yeah sorry. i'm a developer and do a lot of GPU programming :)
2014-02-09 00:08:20	leachim6	haha no need, you've much exceeded my abilities
2014-02-09 00:08:46	sixninetynine	grumblez: mine some dogezz
2014-02-09 00:09:24	grumblez	heh well I do have the AMD W9000, W8000, and a 7950 in my machine at work right now. could probably set that up

2014-02-09 00:11:01	grumblez	could probably heat the entire building with that setup too ;)
2014-02-09 00:13:17	grumblez	was doing lots of OpenCL testing on AMD cards on Friday. Finally found a workaround for a shitty bug in AMD's Windows drivers that we reported to them 9 months ago and they still haven't fixed
2014-02-09 00:14:11	neohaven	grumblez: story of the life of AMD-centric devs. :D
2014-02-09 00:14:55	grumblez	fortunately most of our Windows users are on NVidia, so not to many people noticed how slow AMD cards were on there
2014-02-09 00:15:16	grumblez	the solution we had for the last 9 months up until Thursday was to turn off the OpenCL optimizing pass on Tahiti processors
2014-02-09 00:15:26	grumblez	got it to work, but fucking slow
2014-02-09 00:16:35	grumblez	but now we're back to CPU Decompression bound instead of shitty GPU driver bound on AMD/Windows :)

2014-02-09 00:21:18	slumberland1	i'm just a different type of nerd
2014-02-09 00:21:47	slumberland1	i'm working on upgrading a tasting bar from 'pretty good' to 'pimp as fuck'
2014-02-09 00:22:05	slumberland1	so some EE (3x VV 16A lines) and some RBA hacking
2014-02-09 00:22:17	grumblez	nice
2014-02-09 00:22:38	slumberland1	i'm hafl tempted to make a female 510 - bnc and a bnc - male 10
2014-02-09 00:23:14	slumberland1	i want this to be the best tasting bar in the state, if not the coast
2014-02-09 00:23:57	slumberland1	not my shop, but i work there
2014-02-09 00:24:07	slumberland1	and i love working the juicebar, but hate how its laid out right now
2014-02-09 00:24:11	grumblez	sounds like it's going to be a pretty badass setup :)
2014-02-09 00:24:15	slumberland1	this is laziness as motivation to work :D
2014-02-09 00:24:27	grumblez	lol
2014-02-09 00:24:37	slumberland1	it should be. right now, the only problem is that 2 of the juice lines won't work in the RBA i want to use
2014-02-09 00:24:48	slumberland1	I was to use mini gennies so i can laser etch the flavor names on
2014-02-09 00:25:41	slumberland1	but it won't work well with 20/80, and even worse with 10/90
2014-02-09 00:25:50	slumberland1	so i think need to switch the rope up
2014-02-09 00:25:56	slumberland1	right now its 7x7 1/16"
2014-02-09 00:26:12	slumberland1	i've heard 7x19 1/16" while harder to cut clean wicks VG better
2014-02-09 00:26:14	slumberland1	we'll see
2014-02-09 00:26:21	slumberland1	i want those juices in drippers anyway
2014-02-09 00:26:25	sixninetynine	worst thing about vaping: stickyness, stickyness everywhere
2014-02-09 00:26:28	sixninetynine	mod is sticky, hands are sticky
2014-02-09 00:26:32	sixninetynine	fucking sticky ass juice
2014-02-09 00:26:42	slumberland1	imagine a shop with motherfuckers powervaping max VG all day
2014-02-09 00:26:50	slumberland1	windexing like every 3 hours is the only way to go
2014-02-09 00:26:56	slumberland1	if not more frequently
2014-02-09 00:27:04	slumberland1	2 rolls of paper towels a day minimum
2014-02-09 00:27:47	lumixter	oh a shop
2014-02-09 00:27:54	lumixter	was about to say how are you going through that much lol
2014-02-09 00:28:14	slumberland1	yeah
2014-02-09 00:28:17	slumberland1	i do 3 days a week
2014-02-09 00:28:20	slumberland1	trying to get 4
2014-02-09 00:28:25	slumberland1	or a float day
2014-02-09 00:29:35	slumberland1	  nice shop, great prices, too many fucking kids
