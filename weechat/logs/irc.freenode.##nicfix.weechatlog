2014-02-08 12:28:01	cdsboy1	so close to having weechat to exactly where I want it T_T
2014-02-08 12:30:55	@driftx	I think I'm giving up for now, there's just no way to theme it how it want it the stupid way they've separated content from colors
2014-02-08 12:31:13	@driftx	totally screwed that sentence up, but you get the idea.

2014-02-08 12:32:11	cdsboy1	You refereing to the fact that if you basically get text and delimiter colors?
2014-02-08 12:32:17	@driftx	hmm, apparently there is some kind of color interpolation
2014-02-08 12:32:20	cdsboy1	yeah
2014-02-08 12:32:24	cdsboy1	it's weird to use though
2014-02-08 12:32:38	@driftx	I mean like there's 'prefix' which you set for text, then 'prefix_color' for the color, so the text can't be mixed colors
2014-02-08 12:32:53	@driftx	or I guess it can, but now you have the color defined in different places, wtf.
2014-02-08 12:33:02	cdsboy1	I was under the impression that you could do it
2014-02-08 12:33:06	cdsboy1	it's just kind of magicy
2014-02-08 12:33:18	@driftx	I think you can do ${color:242} or something like that
2014-02-08 12:34:26	cdsboy1	hmm
2014-02-08 12:34:28	cdsboy1	let me test it
2014-02-08 12:35:47	cdsboy1	hmmm
2014-02-08 12:36:04	cdsboy1	didn't seem to work in the title bar for me
2014-02-08 12:37:36	cdsboy1	ah
2014-02-08 12:37:51	cdsboy1	it's only possible in things where content is evaluated apparently
2014-02-08 12:37:59	cdsboy1	so the title bar doesn't work
2014-02-08 12:38:01	@driftx	that's even worse
2014-02-08 12:38:34	cdsboy1	you can do it in things like timestamp format
2014-02-08 12:38:41	cdsboy1	but it seems like there isn't a ton of places where it works in
2014-02-08 12:38:55	cdsboy1	that's kind of frustrating, but it doesn't actually affect me because I'm a big fan of flat colors
2014-02-08 12:40:04	@driftx	what really bothers me is the hotlist ordering isn't by buffer number
2014-02-08 12:41:19	cdsboy1	I'm not using their builtin hotlist
2014-02-08 12:41:38	cdsboy1	I'm using a plugin called buffers
2014-02-08 12:41:49	cdsboy1	which basically makes it act like irssi's lsit
2014-02-08 12:41:51	cdsboy1	list*
2014-02-08 12:43:52	@driftx	which plugin is this?
2014-02-08 12:45:28	cdsboy1	it's literally just called buffers

2014-02-08 12:52:14	@cdsboy	also, their nicklist sucks
2014-02-08 12:52:17	@driftx	is it buffers.pl?
2014-02-08 12:52:19	@cdsboy	there has to be a way to get a better nicklist
2014-02-08 12:52:23	@cdsboy	driftx: just use /scripts
2014-02-08 12:52:25	@driftx	like /list?
2014-02-08 12:52:37	@driftx	cuz yeah, that list does suck
2014-02-08 12:52:49	@cdsboy	oh btw
2014-02-08 12:52:52	@cdsboy	don't type /list
2014-02-08 12:52:58	@cdsboy	it lists all the channels on the network T_T
2014-02-08 12:52:59	@driftx	err, /names

2014-02-08 12:53:06	@cdsboy	erm
2014-02-08 12:53:09	@cdsboy	it's /script
2014-02-08 12:53:10	@cdsboy	mb
2014-02-08 12:53:20	@driftx	nope, heh
2014-02-08 12:53:21	@cdsboy	weechat has a build in plugin manager
2014-02-08 12:53:35	@cdsboy	well
2014-02-08 12:53:35	@driftx	do I need to download the script?
2014-02-08 12:53:38	@cdsboy	maybe
2014-02-08 12:53:41	@cdsboy	it came with mine
2014-02-08 12:53:47	@driftx	let's start there, cuz searching for 'buffers' gets me nowhere
2014-02-08 12:54:05	@cdsboy	oh, apparently it's a portage flag to auto install the script manager
2014-02-08 13:08:58	@driftx	I'm not sure if whatever I'm going to get out of this is worth the effort anymore
2014-02-08 13:09:10	@cdsboy	It's probably not
2014-02-08 13:09:13	@cdsboy	I was bored this morning
2014-02-08 13:09:28	@cdsboy	otherwise I wouldn't have messed around with it
2014-02-08 13:11:25	@driftx	buffers.pl is definitely not what I want
2014-02-08 13:13:51	@driftx	what's it called in your /plugin list?
2014-02-08 13:17:25	@cdsboy	it's not in my plugin list, it's called buffers.pl in script. What do you want it to do?
2014-02-08 13:17:38	@cdsboy	or what's not correcct about it?
2014-02-08 13:17:47	@cdsboy	s/correcct/correct/
2014-02-08 13:17:47	@wattbot	cdsboy meant to say: or what's not correct about it?
2014-02-08 13:18:54	@cdsboy	http://i.imgur.com/T6P3061.png the very top line is why buffers looks for me
2014-02-08 13:20:25	@cdsboy	gah I just realized ipv6 is turned of for freenode still T_T
2014-02-08 13:20:30	@cdsboy	w/e I'll just leave it for now
2014-02-08 13:20:45	@cdsboy	I guess I'll have to deal with not being cdsboy@cdsboy.com for the time being
2014-02-08 13:24:53	@driftx	yeah, that's not the hotlist
2014-02-08 13:25:04	@driftx	I don't need a list of buffers, I need a list of activity
2014-02-08 13:25:16	@driftx	which I have, just ordering bothers my ocd
2014-02-08 13:25:24	@cdsboy	oh, all of these terms
2014-02-08 13:25:27	@cdsboy	my bad
2014-02-08 13:25:47	@driftx	it's the 'Act: 2,3' in here http://static.faltering.com/weechat.png
2014-02-08 13:26:01	@driftx	which are sorted that time, but most of the time it's the order they received activity
2014-02-08 13:26:17	@driftx	like right now it's [Act: 6(18,1), 4(3)]
