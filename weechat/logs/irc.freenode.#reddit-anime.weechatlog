2014-02-08 15:51:52	swiss	i thought it was $800 before
2014-02-08 15:52:02	swiss	that's not that bad still considering i had a $250 tire cost
2014-02-08 15:52:13	momonome	And you don't have to buy tires next month!
2014-02-08 15:52:15	swiss	that means I like... almost halved my cc bill

2014-02-08 17:13:09	Berzerker	I haven't really hit an out 10Mbps, but I thought I was doing at least that yesterday
2014-02-08 17:14:52	Mushrooshi	everyone here should learn katakana
2014-02-08 17:15:01	Dium	Scko: green onions
2014-02-08 17:15:10	Dium	bamboo, egg, chili powder, sesame seeds
2014-02-08 17:15:13	Scko	Mushrooshi, why?
2014-02-08 17:15:18	Mushrooshi	like, i swear 1/4th of japanese website words are just english words in katakana
2014-02-08 17:15:21	Scko	Dium, ty for the ideas
2014-02-08 17:15:36	Mushrooshi	if you can identify that, you can usually get your way around a good number of sites
2014-02-08 17:15:57	kirun	Often, you can get around because the file names are in English
2014-02-08 17:16:06	Mushrooshi	since a lot of "internet-specific" words (like "download" "log in" "email") are just katakana
2014-02-08 17:16:10	kirun	Hover over link, read status bar
2014-02-08 17:16:15	Mushrooshi	that works too
2014-02-08 17:16:43	Mushrooshi	but katakana is easy to learn (and it parallels hiragana, though hiragana is a lot less useful without any native japanese word knowledge)
2014-02-08 17:17:01	Scko	you still haven't given me a good reason, as an American, to learn some foreign jibber jabber
2014-02-08 17:17:43	Dium	you can watch animay raws
2014-02-08 17:17:45	Mushrooshi	you can learn how to easily infiltrate the moonspeaker territory, and spread freedom
2014-02-08 17:17:56	Dium	without subs
2014-02-08 17:18:02	Mushrooshi	Dium: not quite...
2014-02-08 17:18:09	Mushrooshi	you still need to learn vocabulary...
2014-02-08 17:18:19	Dium	well yeah
2014-02-08 17:18:21	Mushrooshi	and katakana is one of the three writing forms of it...
2014-02-08 17:18:27	Scko	Mushrooshi, but we already freedomized them at the end of WWII
2014-02-08 17:18:31	Dium	you know what i mean though
2014-02-08 17:18:48	Mushrooshi	well, katakana is a writing system...
2014-02-08 17:18:55	Mushrooshi	sooo... your comparison is flawed...
2014-02-08 17:18:59	Mushrooshi	unless you're being sarcastic
2014-02-08 17:19:06	Mushrooshi	which it just occured to me you probably were.
2014-02-08 17:20:51	Mushrooshi	on an unrelated note...
2014-02-08 17:21:21	Mushrooshi	my oldoldold macbook is being put to good use in my fucked up hybrid of a collection shelf and DDR home cab.
2014-02-08 17:21:27	Mushrooshi	(inb4 macfag, all my shits linux or windows now)
2014-02-08 17:22:01	Mushrooshi	actually, it was thanks to this channel a hell of a long time ago that I got a thinkpad.
2014-02-08 17:22:24	Hairo	i like mac hardware
2014-02-08 17:22:29	Scko	who cares if you have a mac?

2014-02-08 17:23:05	Mushrooshi	Scko: I'm actually surprised... lots of channels (and this one especially, due to all the neckbeards in here) get caustically violent any time macs are mentioned.

2014-02-08 21:54:03	Edes	I'm guessing the RNG is weighted so that the pipes are close to eachother, right?
2014-02-08 21:54:15	swiss	OrangeRange: only when i look for real conversation and run into the same stuff

2014-02-08 21:54:28	swiss	and the same stuff isn't even people enjoying something, it's people hating on someone else enjoying something
2014-02-08 21:54:48	mechapanda	when playing soloqueue, it can be luck based, you have a horrible team and the enemy just has a team that can stomp yours, the enemy is more in your face than your team is and your team can't handle that
2014-02-08 21:54:49	OrangeRange	yeah....the people hating thing i wouldn't like
2014-02-08 21:54:50	mechapanda	even if you can

2014-02-08 21:55:16	swiss	volfaren brought it up in one of the only ways that a non-douchebag can :P He brought up a new interesting point with it that has nothing to do with whether he liked the game or not
2014-02-08 21:55:42	OrangeRange	so i think we should talk about something else

2014-02-08 21:56:22	OrangeRange	swiss: holy shit really? :(
2014-02-08 21:56:26	volfaren	swiss: but the point of bringing it up in the first place is to engage conversation

2014-02-08 21:56:40	OrangeRange	lol space dandy is ok if you don't care about continuity lol
